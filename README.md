## Description:
### The Heart Disease Analysis project involves analysing a dataset related to heart disease to identify key factors that contribute to heart disease occurrence. The goal is to use data analytics techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features. The analysis aims to provide insights that can help in early diagnosis and prevention.

## Responsibility:
### 1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to understand the distribution of data, relationships between variables.

### 3. Question Formulation: Developed specific minimum 7 questions related to heart disease, and solve each question by using appropriate functions.

### 4. Data Visualization: Created visualizations using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, to effectively present the findings and insights gained from the analysis. This included charts, graphs, and other visual aids to make theresults easy to understand.
